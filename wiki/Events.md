# Message Responses

## Message Edits

If you edit a message, DuckBot will give you a helpful diff of the changes.

> Human: I hate you.

Say that's edited to:

> Human: I don't hate you.

Then DuckBot will respond with the following message (it is deleted after a short period).

> DuckBot: :eyes: @Human\
> I {+don't +}hate you.

## Haiku

DuckBot will let you know if a message is a 5/7/5 haiku.

## Stocks

DuckBot will try to provide basic stock information for any word starting with `$` in a message.

> Human: Hurb. $amzn tho.\
> DuckBot: AMZN (Amazon.com, Inc.): $3,507.07 (USD) per share, -1.53% today; +10.61% over a year

## Bitcoin

DuckBot kindly corrects the spelling of _bitcoin_ to _magic beans_.

## Kubernetes

DuckBot kindly corrects the spelling of _k8s_ to _kubernetes_. Additionally, DuckBot corrects the spelling of _kubernetes_ to _k8s_.

## Bezos

Jeff Bezos is no longer the CEO of Amazon, and thus has no reason to ever be spoken about ever again. DuckBot reminds you of the new and improved Andy Jassy when this slips your mind.

## Formula One

DuckBot gets HYPED UP over posts to the F1 related `#dank` channel, so it reacts to every single message there.

## Age of Empires

DuckBot will replace any [Age of Empires II taunts](https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Taunts#Full_list_of_taunts) with their text expansion. For example,

> Human: 2\
> DuckBot: @Human > 2: No.

## Josip Broz Tito

Heeeyyyy Mr. Tito! DuckBot will react to messages containing the custom `:tito:` emoji with all the country flags of the formally Yugoslavian countries. DuckBot will do the same when someone reacts with `:tito:`.

## Office Hours

Don't forget to stop by and ask questions! DuckBot will notify the general channel when office hours start, brother.

## Typo Correction

DuckBot will attempt to correct typos a user's previous message when they send _fuck_. For example,

> Human: I wanted to eat teh duck wiht thier creamy sauce.\
> Human: fuck\
> DuckBot:
>
> > I wanted to eat the duck with their creamy sauce.
>
> There, I fixed it for you, @Human!

## DuckBoard

DuckBot has a very small chance to react to any message with ðŸ¦† .

## Robot

DuckBot is a robot, and as such does not like being humanized. DuckBot tells people to stop thanking a robot when they explicitly thank the robot.

# Scheduled Tasks

## Day Announcements

Every day in the 7am hour, DuckBot will announce to the general channel the current day of the week. If the day is also a statutory holiday, or an otherwise special day, DuckBot will announce that at the same time. You can run this on demand using the `!day` command.
