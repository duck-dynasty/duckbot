A Discord bot for personal friend group. If you don't know me personally, consider how freaking weird it'd be to ask for the access token. Feel free to steal the code though.

View the [wiki](https://github.com/Chippers255/duckbot/wiki) for a short description on what the Duck does.

## Development
Before running DuckBot or any other scripts, you need to create a virtualenv to develop in. The `venv.sh` script will setup and activate the duckbot virtual environment. Run it before you run any other scripts to ensure you're using the right environment.

The `venv.sh` script expects `python3.8` to be on the `$PATH` if it needs to build a new environment.

```sh
. scripts/venv.sh
```

This creates a `venv` directory for your virtual environment, which you can use in whatever IDE you prefer.

### Install Dependencies
Should be run whenever you pull from `upstream/main`, or after you create the virtual environment for the first time.
```sh
. scripts/build/install.sh
```

### Run Tests & Formatter
```sh
pytest  # runs tests, lint and format checks
. scripts/build/format.sh
```

The tests also collects code coverage. [View the configuration](https://github.com/Chippers255/duckbot/blob/main/pyproject.toml) to see the minimum required coverage. Discord.py decorators make it difficult to cover methods directly, so don't aim for 100% coverage.


### Run DuckBot
DuckBot runs using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), so ensure that is installed along with docker itself.  
Requires `duckbut/.env` to be present, and the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable to be set therein. The process will be killed after an hour.
```
. scripts/duckbot.sh
```

The `duckbot/.env` file should look something like this:
```
duck@pond$ cat duckbot/.env
DISCORD_TOKEN=thesecrettoken
```
