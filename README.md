A Discord bot for personal friend group. If you don't know me personally, consider how freaking weird it'd be to ask for the access token. Feel free to steal the code though.

## Development
The `scripts/build` directory contains scripts for development.

### Install Dependencies
Should be run whenever you pull from `upstream/main`.
```sh
. scripts/build/install.sh
```

### Run Tests and Linter
```sh
. scripts/build/test.sh
. scripts/build/lint.sh
```

### Containerized Tests
If you like containers, you can also run all the tests as part of a docker image build. If the docker image is built, all the tests passed. The script deletes the image afterwards, pass or fail.
```sh
. scripts/build/docker-test.sh
```

### Run DuckBot
Requires `duckbut/.env` to be present, and the `TOKEN` environment variable to be set therein. The process will be killed after an hour.
```
. scripts/duckbot.sh
```
